   Click listener for test button

	 You'll learn more about this in upcoming courses

	// WRITE YOUR CODE HERE!!! - Complete the steps below 

	// 1) If you haven't already, preview the index.html file in Chrome, and open the Chrome DevTools
    // If you don't know how to do any of those things, please reach out in Slack for some friendly guidance and support
		// PRO TIP: This exercise promotes getting in the habit of logging values to the console after every few lines of code. This process will save you time and debugging headaches down the road.
		

	// 2) Create a variable containing a string and log it and its data type to the console

const name = "Katie";
console.log(name);

    // Create a variable named myString and set it equal to the string 'Treehouse rocks', like so: var myString = 'Treehouse rocks';
		// Use console.log(mysString); to log out the mysString variable
		// Use console.log(typeof mysString); to log out the data type of the mysString variable
    // Take a moment to inspect and familiarize yourself with the results in the console
		// NOTE: Comment out or delete log statements that you don't need any more to keep from overcrowding the console
		

	// 3) Create a variable containing a number and log it and its data type to the console
    // Create a variable named myNumber and set it equal to a number between 1 and 10, like so: var myNumber = 7;
		// Use console.log(myNumber); to log out the myNumber variable
		// Use console.log(typeof myNumber); to log out the data type of the myNumber variable
    // Take a moment to inspect and familiarize yourself with the results in the console


	// 4) Create variable containing a boolean and log it and its data type to the console
    // Create a variable named myBoolean and set it equal to the keyword true, like so: var myBoolean = true;
    // Use console.log(myBoolean); to log out the myBoolean variable
		// Now, change the value of the myBoolean variable to the keyword false, like so: myBoolean = false; 
		// Log out the myBoolean variable again to see the difference in the console
		// Use console.log(typeof myBoolean); to log out the data type of the myBoolean variable
    // Take a moment to inspect and familiarize yourself with the results in the console


	// 5) Experiment with different ways of logging out information by logging out a DOM element
	  // NOTE: If you don't know what a DOM element is, don't worry, you'll learn more about that in upcoming courses
		// Create a variable named myElement and set it equal to the step-1 div from the index.html file, like so:
		  // var myElement = document.querySelector('#step-1');
		// Use console.log(myElement); to log out the myElement variable
		// Use console.table(myElement); to log out a more detailed representation of the myElement variable
		// Use console.dir(myElement); to log out the myElement variable as an object
		// Take a moment to inspect and familiarize yourself with the results in the console
		// NOTE: Feel free to comment out different log statements as needed so you can focus on one at a time


  // Helpful log statement to test function - You can comment out this if you like
  console.log('Test button is functional!');
