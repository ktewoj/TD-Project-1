## Logging Values and Types

### Intro

Along with learning code, as a developer, it's also important to develop good coding habits, an effective workflow, and a familiarity with some core concepts like basic debugging and logging out your code regularly and often to test its values. In this exercise, youâ€™ll follow a set of instructions to log valuable information to the console to get a glimpse under the hood.

### Instructions

Load the `index.html` file in Chrome and open the Chrome DevTools console.  If you don't know how to do that, please reach out in Slack.  Next, follow along with the comments in the `js/script.js` file to complete this challenge.  When you are done, clicking the "Test" button should print your log statements to the console, and provide you with some insight and an inside look at the data behind the code you are writing.

If you get stuck or have questions, reach out in the `#code-adventures` channel in your Slack team.

Best of luck and happy coding! :)
