## Conditional String

### Intro

Developers work with conditionals all the time to test if an object or element exists, what its value is, and perform certain actions depending on the results.  You'll do this in the Random Quote Generator project.  Here’s some lightweight practice working with conditionals.  You’ll use JavaScript to conditionally build a string from the properties of a provided random object.  Then you'll print that string to the page.

### Instructions

 Load the `index.html` file in Chrome and open the Chrome DevTools console.  If you don't know how to do that, please reach out in Slack.  Next, follow along with the comments in the `js/script.js` file to complete this challenge.  When you are done, you'll be able to click the "Print" button and compare your printed conditionally generated string to the provided character stats on the page.

If you get stuck or have questions, reach out in the `#code-adventures` channel in your Slack team.

Best of luck and happy coding! :)
